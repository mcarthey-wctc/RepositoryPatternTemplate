# Template

This template serves as a foundation for starting new applications. It comes pre-configured with several libraries to streamline your development process.

## Pre-configured Libraries

The following libraries are already included in this solution:

- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console
- NReco.Logging.File
- Newtonsoft.Json (also known as Json.NET) 

If you encounter issues or wish to add similar functionality to your own application, you can import these libraries.

## Adding Libraries with DotNet CLI

If you need to add these libraries to your project, you can use the following .NET CLI commands:

- dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console
- dotnet add package NReco.Logging.File
- dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
